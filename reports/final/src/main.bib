Illustris is a suite of large volume, cosmological hydrodynamical simulations run with the moving-mesh code Arepo and including a comprehensive set of physical models critical for following the formation and evolution of galaxies across cosmic time. Each simulates a volume of (106.5 Mpc)3 and self-consistently evolves five different types of resolution elements from a starting redshift of z=127 to the present day, z=0. These components are: dark matter particles, gas cells, passive gas tracers, stars and stellar wind particles, and supermassive black holes. This data release includes the snapshots at all 136 available redshifts, halo and subhalo catalogs at each snapshot, and two distinct merger trees. Six primary realizations of the Illustris volume are released, including the flagship Illustris-1 run. These include three resolution levels with the fiducial “full” baryonic physics model, and a dark matter only analog for each. In addition, we provide four distinct, high time resolution, smaller volume “subboxes”. The total data volume is ∼265 {TB}, including ∼800 full volume snapshots and ∼30,000 subbox snapshots. We describe the released data products as well as tools we have developed for their analysis. All data may be directly downloaded in its native {HDF}5 format. Additionally, we release a comprehensive, web-based {API} which allows programmatic access to search and data processing tasks. In both cases we provide example scripts and a getting-started guide in several languages: currently, {IDL}, Python, and Matlab. This paper addresses scientific issues relevant for the interpretation of the simulations, serves as a pointer to published and on-line documentation of the project, describes planned future additional data releases, and discusses technical aspects of the release.},

	abstract = {Hydrodynamic cosmological simulations at present usually employ either the Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics ({SPH}) technique or Eulerian hydrodynamics on a Cartesian mesh with (optional) adaptive mesh refinement ({AMR}). Both of these methods have disadvantages that negatively impact their accuracy in certain situations, for example the suppression of fluid instabilities in the case of {SPH}, and the lack of Galilean invariance and the presence of overmixing in the case of {AMR}. We here propose a novel scheme which largely eliminates these weaknesses. It is based on a moving unstructured mesh defined by the Voronoi tessellation of a set of discrete points. The mesh is used to solve the hyperbolic conservation laws of ideal hydrodynamics with a finite-volume approach, based on a second-order unsplit Godunov scheme with an exact Riemann solver. The mesh-generating points can in principle be moved arbitrarily. If they are chosen to be stationary, the scheme is equivalent to an ordinary Eulerian method with second-order accuracy. If they instead move with the velocity of the local flow, one obtains a Lagrangian formulation of continuum hydrodynamics that does not suffer from the mesh distortion limitations inherent in other mesh-based Lagrangian schemes. In this mode, our new method is fully Galilean invariant, unlike ordinary Eulerian codes, a property that is of significant importance for cosmological simulations where highly supersonic bulk flows are common. In addition, the new scheme can adjust its spatial resolution automatically and continuously, and hence inherits the principal advantage of {SPH} for simulations of cosmological structure growth. The high accuracy of Eulerian methods in the treatment of shocks is also retained, while the treatment of contact discontinuities improves. We discuss how this approach is implemented in our new code arepo, both in 2D and in 3D, and is parallelized for distributed memory computers. We also discuss techniques for adaptive refinement or de-refinement of the unstructured mesh. We introduce an individual time-step approach for finite-volume hydrodynamics, and present a high-accuracy treatment of self-gravity for the gas that allows the new method to be seamlessly combined with a high-resolution treatment of collisionless dark matter. We use a suite of test problems to examine the performance of the new code and argue that the hydrodynamic moving-mesh scheme proposed here provides an attractive and competitive alternative to current {SPH} and Eulerian techniques.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present Approximation Schemes for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem ({CVRP}) on several classes of graphs. In {CVRP}, introduced by Dantzig and Ramser in 1959 [13], we are given a graph G = (V, E) with metric edges costs, a depot r ∊ V, and a vehicle of bounded capacity Q. The goal is to find a minimum cost collection of tours for the vehicle that returns to the depot, each visiting at most Q nodes, such that they cover all the nodes. This generalizes classic {TSP} and has been studied extensively. In the more general setting, each node v has a demand dv and the total demand of each tour must be no more than Q. Either the demand of each node must be served by one tour (unsplittable) or can be served by multiple tours (splittable). The best known approximation algorithm for general graphs has ratio α + 2(1–∊) (for the unsplittable) and α + 1–∊ (for the splittable) for some fixed  is the best approximation for {TSP}. Even for the case of trees, the best approximation ratio is 4/3 [5], and it has been an open question if there is an approximation scheme for this simple class of graphs. Das and Mathieu [14] presented an approximation scheme with time  for Euclidean plane ℝ2. No other approximation scheme is known for any other class of metrics (without further restrictions on Q). In this paper, we make significant progress on this classic problem by presenting Quasi-Polynomial Time Approximation Schemes ({QPTAS}) for graphs of bounded treewidth, graphs of bounded highway dimensions, and graphs of bounded doubling dimensions. For comparison, our result implies an approximation scheme for Euclidean plane with run time .},

	abstract = {We present two numerical schemes for passive tracer particles in the hydrodynamical moving-mesh code arepo, and compare their performance for various problems, from simple set-ups to cosmological simulations. The purpose of tracer particles is to allow the flow to be followed in a Lagrangian way, tracing the evolution of the fluid with time, and allowing the thermodynamical history of individual fluid parcels to be recorded. We find that the commonly used ‘velocity field tracers’, which are advected using the fluid velocity field, do not in general follow the mass flow correctly, and explain why this is the case. This method can result in order-of-magnitude biases in simulations of driven turbulence and in cosmological simulations, rendering the velocity field tracers inappropriate for following these flows. We then discuss a novel implementation of ‘Monte Carlo tracers’, which are moved along with fluid cells and are exchanged probabilistically between them following the mass flux. This method reproduces the mass distribution of the fluid correctly. The main limitation of this approach is that it is more diffusive than the fluid itself. Nonetheless, we show that this novel approach is more reliable than that has been employed previously and demonstrate that it is appropriate for following hydrodynamical flows in mesh-based codes. The Monte Carlo tracers can also naturally be transferred between fluid cells and other types of particles, such as stellar particles, so that the mass flow in cosmological simulations can be followed in its entirety.},

The highest resolution simulation, Illustris-1, covers a volume of (106.5{舁Mpc})3, has a dark mass resolution of 6.26 × 106{舁M}⊙, and an initial baryonic matter mass resolution of 1.26 × 106{舁M}⊙. At z = 0 gravitational forces are softened on scales of 710舁pc, and the smallest hydrodynamical gas cells have an extent of 48舁pc. We follow the dynamical evolution of 2 × 18203 resolution elements and in addition passively evolve 18203 Monte Carlo tracer particles reaching a total particle count of more than 18 billion. The galaxy formation model includes: primordial and metal-line cooling with self-shielding corrections, stellar evolution, stellar feedback, gas recycling, chemical enrichment, supermassive black hole growth, and feedback from active galactic nuclei. Here we describe the simulation suite, and contrast basic predictions of our model for the present-day galaxy population with observations of the local universe. At z = 0 our simulation volume contains about 40舁000 well-resolved galaxies covering a diverse range of morphologies and colours including early-type, late-type and irregular galaxies. The simulation reproduces reasonably well the cosmic star formation rate density, the galaxy luminosity function, and baryon conversion efficiency at z = 0. It also qualitatively captures the impact of galaxy environment on the red fractions of galaxies. The internal velocity structure of selected well-resolved disc galaxies obeys the stellar and baryonic Tully–Fisher relation together with flat circular velocity curves. In the well-resolved regime, the simulation reproduces the observed mix of early-type and late-type galaxies. Our model predicts a halo mass dependent impact of baryonic effects on the halo mass function and the masses of haloes caused by feedback from supernova and active galactic nuclei.},

	abstract = {We present a new method for calculating linear cosmic microwave background ({CM} B) anisotropy spectra based on integration over sources along the photon past light cone. In this approach the temperature anisotropy is written as a time integral over the product of a geometrical term and a source term. The geometrical term is given by radial eigenfunctions, which do not depend on the particular cosmological model. The source term can be expressed in terms of photon, baryon, and metric perturbations, all of which can be calculated using a small number of differential equations. This split clearly separates the dynamical from the geometrical effects on the {CMB} anisotropies. More importantly, it allows us to significantly reduce the computational time compared to standard methods. This is achieved because the source term, which depends on the model and is generally the most time-consuming part of calculation, is a slowly varying function of wavelength and needs to be evaluated only in a small number of points. The geometrical term, which oscillates much more rapidly than the source term, does not depend on the particular model and can be precomputed in advance. Standard methods that do not separate the two terms require a much higher number of evaluations. The new method leads to about 2 orders of magnitude reduction in {CPU} time when compared to standard methods and typically requires a few minutes on a workstation for a single model. The method should be especially useful for accurate determinations of cosmological parameters from {CMB} anisotropy and polarization measurements that will become with the next generation of experiments. A program implementing this method can be obtained from the authors.},

The {WMAP} data alone, and in combination, continue to be remarkably well fit by a six-parameter Λ{CDM} model. When {WMAP} data are combined with measurements of the high-l cosmic microwave background anisotropy, the baryon acoustic oscillation scale, and the Hubble constant, the matter and energy densities, Ω b h 2, Ω c h 2, and ΩΛ, are each determined to a precision of {\textasciitilde}1.5\%. The amplitude of the primordial spectrum is measured to within 3\%, and there is now evidence for a tilt in the primordial spectrum at the 5σ level, confirming the first detection of tilt based on the five-year {WMAP} data. At the end of the {WMAP} mission, the nine-year data decrease the allowable volume of the six-dimensional Λ{CDM} parameter space by a factor of 68,000 relative to pre-{WMAP} measurements. We investigate a number of data combinations and show that their Λ{CDM} parameter fits are consistent. New limits on deviations from the six-parameter model are presented, for example: the fractional contribution of tensor modes is limited to r {\textless} 0.13 (95\% {CL}); the spatial curvature parameter is limited to {\textbackslash}Omega \_k = -0.0027{\textasciicircum}\{+ 0.0039\}\_\{- 0.0038\}; the summed mass of neutrinos is limited to ∑m ν {\textless} 0.44 {eV} (95\% {CL}); and the number of relativistic species is found to lie within N eff = 3.84 ± 0.40, when the full data are analyzed. The joint constraint on N eff and the primordial helium abundance, Y He, agrees with the prediction of standard big bang nucleosynthesis. We compare recent Planck measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect with our seven-year measurements, and show their mutual agreement. Our analysis of the polarization pattern around temperature extrema is updated. This confirms a fundamental prediction of the standard cosmological model and provides a striking illustration of acoustic oscillations and adiabatic initial conditions in the early universe.},

Euler's equations of hydrodynamics are solved using a modified version of the piecewise parabolic method.

In this paper, we give a detailed description of the magnetohydrodynamical ({MHD}) algorithms in {ZEUS}-2D. The recently developed constrained transport ({CT}) algorithm is implemented for the numerical evolution of the components of the magnetic field for {MHD} simulations. This formalism guarantees the numerically evolved field components will satisfy the divergence-free constraint at all times. We find, however, that the method used to compute the electromotive forces must be chosen carefully to propagate accurately all modes of {MHD} wave families (in particular shear Alfvén waves). A new method of computing the electromotive force is developed using the method of characteristics ({MOC}). It is demonstrated through the results of an extensive series of {MHD} test problems that the resulting hybrid {MOC}-{CT} method provides for the accurate evolution of all modes of {MHD} wave families.},

	abstract = {Generative deep learning methods built upon Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNNs}) provide a great tool for predicting non-linear structure in cosmology. In this work we predict high resolution dark matter halos from large scale, low resolution dark matter only simulations. This is achieved by mapping lower resolution to higher resolution density fields of simulations sharing the same cosmology, initial conditions and box-sizes. To resolve structure down to a factor of 8 increase in mass resolution, we use a variation of U-Net with a conditional {GAN}, generating output that visually and statistically matches the high resolution target extremely well. This suggests that our method can be used to create high resolution density output over Gpc/h box-sizes from low resolution simulations with negligible computational effort.},

	abstract = {An earlier paper (Szalay et. al. "Designing and Mining {MultiTerabyte} Astronomy Archives: The Sloan Digital Sky Survey," {ACM} {SIGMOD} 2000) described the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's ({SDSS}) data management needs by defining twenty database queries and twelve data visualization tasks that a good data management system should support. We built a database and interfaces to support both the query load and also a website for ad-hoc access. This paper reports on the database design, describes the data loading pipeline, and reports on the query implementation and performance. The queries typically translated to a single {SQL} statement. Most queries run in less than 20 seconds, allowing scientists to interactively explore the database. This paper is an in-depth tour of those queries. Readers should first have studied the companion overview paper Szalay et. al. "The {SDSS} {SkyServer}, Public Access to the Sloan Digital Sky Server Data" {ACM} {SIGMOND} 2002.},

One of the first of these projects, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ({SDSS}) will create a 5-wavelength catalog over 10,000 square degrees of the sky. The 200 million objects in the multi-terabyte database will have mostly numerical attributes, defining a space of 100+ dimensions. Points in this space have highly correlated distributions. The archive will enable astronomers to explore the data interactively. Data access will be aided by multidimensional spatial indices. The data will be partitioned in many ways. Small tag objects consisting of the most popular attributes speed up frequent searches. Splitting the data among multiple servers enables parallel, scalable I/O. Hashing techniques allow efficient clustering and pairwise comparison algorithms. Randomly sampled subsets allow debugging otherwise large queries at the desktop. Central servers will operate a data pump that supports sweeping searches that touch most of the data.},

	abstract = {The Millennium Run is the largest simulation of the formation of structure within the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} cosmogony so far carried out. It uses \$10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}\$ particles to follow the dark matter distribution in a cubic region 500\$h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$Mpc on a side, and has a spatial resolution of 5 \$h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$kpc. Application of simplified modelling techniques to the stored output of this calculation allows the formation and evolution of the \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}7\$ galaxies more luminous than the Small Magellanic Cloud to be simulated for a variety of assumptions about the detailed physics involved. As part of the activities of the German Astrophysical Virtual Observatory we have used a relational database to store the detailed assembly histories both of all the haloes and subhaloes resolved by the simulation, and of all the galaxies that form within these structures for two independent models of the galaxy formation physics. We have created web applications that allow users to query these databases remotely using the standard Structured Query Language ({SQL}). This allows easy access to all properties of the galaxies and halos, as well as to the spatial and temporal relations between them and their environment. Information is output in table format compatible with standard Virtual Observatory tools and protocols. With this announcement we are making these structures fully accessible to all users. Interested scientists can learn {SQL}, gain familiarity with the database design and test queries on a small, openly accessible version of the Millennium Run (with volume 1/512 that of the full simulation). They can then request accounts to run similar queries on the databases for the full simulations.},

	abstract = {We discuss a new algorithm to generate multi-scale initial conditions with multiple levels of refinements for cosmological "zoom-in" simulations. The method uses an adaptive convolution of Gaussian white noise with a real space transfer function kernel together with an adaptive multi-grid Poisson solver to generate displacements and velocities following first (1LPT) or second order Lagrangian perturbation theory (2LPT). The new algorithm achieves {RMS} relative errors of order 10{\textasciicircum}(-4) for displacements and velocities in the refinement region and thus improves in terms of errors by about two orders of magnitude over previous approaches. In addition, errors are localized at coarse-fine boundaries and do not suffer from Fourier-space induced interference ringing. An optional hybrid multi-grid and Fast Fourier Transform ({FFT}) based scheme is introduced which has identical Fourier space behaviour as traditional approaches. Using a suite of re-simulations of a galaxy cluster halo our real space based approach is found to reproduce correlation functions, density profiles, key halo properties and subhalo abundances with per cent level accuracy. Finally, we generalize our approach for two-component baryon and dark-matter simulations and demonstrate that the power spectrum evolution is in excellent agreement with linear perturbation theory. For initial baryon density fields, it is suggested to use the local Lagrangian approximation in order to generate a density field for mesh based codes that is consistent with Lagrangian perturbation theory instead of the current practice of using the Eulerian linearly scaled densities.},

The basic idea is that at accelerations below ao ≈ 10−8 cm/s2 ≈ {cHo}/6 the effective gravitational attraction approaches , where gn is the usual Newtonian acceleration. This simple algorithm yields flat rotation curves for spiral galaxies and a mass-rotation velocity relation of the form M ∝ V4 that forms the basis for the observed luminosity–rotation velocity relation—the Tully-Fisher law. We review the phenomenological success of {MOND} on scales ranging from dwarf spheroidal galaxies to superclusters and demonstrate that the evidence for dark matter can be equally well interpreted as evidence for {MOND}. We discuss the possible physical basis for an acceleration-based modification of Newtonian dynamics as well as the extention of {MOND} to cosmology and structure formation.},

	abstract = {We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via adversarial nets, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitatively evaluation of the generated samples.},
