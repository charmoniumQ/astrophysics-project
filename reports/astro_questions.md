- Dependencies take a significant amount of time (median > 5 hrs), frustrating (median > 3), similar problems in research (average > 0.7), and interest in tool (average > 0.5).
  - This motivates Spack and quantifies its savings.
- Conda (average > 0.1)
  - People probably use Conda. But it only supports some software packages. Not as good as Spack.
- Module load (average > 0.3)
  - Module load is installed on the cluster, but it only supports a limited amount of pre-installed software. Not as good as Spack.
- Slurm is frustrating (median > 3), use similar tool in research (median > 0.5), interest in tool (average > 0.3)
  - This motivates highlevel-slurm
- Accessing files remotely is easy (median < 3), used in research (median > 0.8), use rsync (median > 0.1), use filezilla (median > 0.3)
- Not Reproducible (median < 0.4)
